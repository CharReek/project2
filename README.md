# The Ultimate Fashion Quiz
We all want to be the best at what we know,The ultimate fashion quiz is designed to test the users knowledge on all things luxury fashion. This interactive quiz gives users the ability to select one of four answers to each question. This quiz gives the users an opportunity to both learn and test there knowlege of a mix of easy and hard questions.The score section can add competition between friends or even agaist your previous score. 
This site is designed for users who enjoy both fashion and coding and want to fuse the two together. This is my first step into bringing the two things i enjoy most coding and fashion into the same space so those like me can enjoy the two things together.
# Features 
## Excisting Features 
 
 * Header 
    * The white logo is positioned at the top of the page in the center so it stands out from the backgorund. The user will automatically know what the quiz is about and what page they have landed on. The white text colour stands out form the backgound and used one of the colours i selected for my colour pallet.

 ### Feautures left to impliment 
  * Progress Bar 
  One feautre i would like to impliment is a progress bar, so that the users know how far into the quiz they are and how many questions they have left. This would be a great feature to add for users as they are more likely to close the quiz down if they believe its going to be too time consuming.
  * More Questions 
  I would also like to add more questiosn to the quiz and set a question limit to 10 so that every time you play the quiz you get a different selection of questions. therefore testing the users knowledge on fashion and entising them in to try again. 

  # Testing
  I tested this page mutiple times to ensure that every button that was clicked returned the correct colour on each question depending on what the user clicks. I did this by noting down what options i chose each time to ensure that I checked all of the different answer options. I made sure that the score function increased when i needed to and decreaed at the correct times.
